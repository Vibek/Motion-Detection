================

Motion detection using convex hull method.

This respository is the part of motion detection project using Kinect vision sensor and contains ROS packages. The projects includes the following:

1. A modified ROS packages for motion detection in both Depth and RGB frames.
2. Recognizing motion using convex hull method.
3. Save the region where the motion is detected (position in x,y corodinates) in a txt file.
4. Write the threshold images when motion is detected in a folder named "pics".

MotionDetection.Cfg file is not given due to high privancy.

If the user need the cfg. file, should ping me in my official Email-address: vibek@meil.pw.edu.pl
